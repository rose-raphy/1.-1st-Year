# Initiate numbers to variables to find the remainder when divided
number1=int(input("Enter 1st number:"))
number2=int(input("Enter 2nd number:"))

# To print Remainder of the two numbers 
print("Remainder when", number1, "is divided by", number2, "is", number1%number2)
```

OUTPUT :Enter 1st number: 3
        Enter 2nd number: 2
        Remainder when 3 is divided by 2 is 1

```python
#9 Swap two variables

#Initiate two variables with values to swap
number1 = int(input("Enter 1st number:"))
number2 = int(input("Enter 2nd number:"))

# Prints values before swapping
print("Before swapping -> 1st number:",number1,", 2nd number:",number2)

#Initiate a variable for swapping
swap_variable = number1

#With the help of the swap variable, swap number1 and number2 accordingly
number1 = number2
number2 = swap_variable

# Prints values after swapping
print("After swapping -> 1st number",number1,", 2nd number:",number2)
```

OUTPUT :Enter 1st number: 4
        Enter 2nd number: 8
        
        Before swapping -> 1st number: 4 , 2nd number: 8
        After swapping -> 1st number 8 , 2nd number: 4
